# Angular CLI Workshop

During this workshop we will explore the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) and how it can help you quickly and easily develop single-page web applications by creating a basic one from scratch. What we will learn includes how to:

* Scaffold a new Angular application and understand its basic structure
* Create reusable components
* Route between multiple "pages"
* Share data/state across the application with services
* Fetch data from a back-end / async stuff??

## Setup

Ahead of this workshop there is a small amount of setup required to install the necessary tooling. Some of the version numbers mentioned below are older, but are meant to be a reference for the minimum we have tested this training upon.
